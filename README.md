# EU4 Settings Selector

Little Python Tool for Europa Universalis 4 to quickly change between sets of settings, without having to manually (de)select DLCs,Mods or other settings.

# How to use:
  - Start the program using settings_selector.py (Python 3 needs to be installed, https://python.org)
  - Set Path to settings.txt (default: Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis 4)
  - Select a name for the current settings you use in EU4 and click "Read Current Settings"
  - If you click "Save Scraped Settings" the current settings will be available under the chosen name in the Selector
  - In the Selector you choose the settings you want and click Use (or delete if you don't need those settings)
  - The Play Section is optional, you can select your path to the "eu4.exe" in the Steam-Directory and then start the game via "Play" after selecting your Settings, alternative you can start the game as usual via steam after selecting your settings

# Which Settings will be saved?
  - Resolution
  - Language
  - Fullscreen & Borderless
  - DLC-Selecton
  - Mod-Selection

# Other Information
  - You can put the scripts (settings_db.py & settings_selector.py) whereever you want
  - The program will generate three files (settings.db, path.txt, playpath.txt) which it uses to save data, if you move the scripts, move these files too. Other than that it's completely portable. 
  - If you use the program, please subcsribe the [Steam Workshop Mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1135450490) for the Tool, which I'd like to use to keep track of amount of users and as a plattform for feedback!
